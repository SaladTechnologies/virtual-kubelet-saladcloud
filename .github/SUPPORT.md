We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/virtual-kubelet-saladcloud/discussions) for general chat and community-provided support for the SaladCloud Virtual Kubelet. The community often chimes in with helpful advice when you have a question, and you may also find yourself providing answers and helping others.
